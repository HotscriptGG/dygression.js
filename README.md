# dygression.js

* This app is still in super early stage. Help me develop it if you wish and can. Cheers *

## What is it?
Single thread chat with dygression system. So you can procrastinate while you work and work while you procrastinate.

## What it is not?
It is NOT a slack or telegram comptetitor. Those are superb products. Do not try to replace them with this app.

## Programming philosophy
As much vanilla javascript as possible. So you can use it as easy as possible.
This is a implementation of different chatapp abstraction paradigm.
It is a private alternative with some special hidden interface focused features. With specific threds operated from the keyboard vim-like style.

## Dependencies
At this development stage there are some open source dependencies, like:
- HTML5Bolierplate;
- Bootstrap;
- jQuery;
